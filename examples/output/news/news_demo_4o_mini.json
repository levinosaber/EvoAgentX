Otherwise use web search. Only get articles published today.\n2) Generate the newsletter and save it directly to the specified file path.\n\nKey things to note:\n- If RSS urls are available, use tools to fetch the articles.\n- You may also search for new RSS urls and relevant articles through tools.\n- You MUST ensure all information is real, retirable, and correct. They can be collected using the websearch toolkit or the rss toolkit\n- You must collect information through tools only instead of making up or guessing.\n- You should use the file toolkit to save the newsletter to the given path.\n- Return TRUE if newsletter was successfully generated and saved, FALSE otherwise.\n",

This is Stage 2 of the two-stage process.\n\n### Two-Stage Process Context\n- **Stage 1 (Completed)**: Lightweight metadata was collected from filtered RSS sources\n- **Stage 2 (Current)**: Now fetch full content only for the most relevant articles\n\n### Instructions\n1. Review the user's goal: <input>{goal}</input>.\n2. Analyze the article metadata: <input>{article_metadata}</input> (this contains only titles, summaries, URLs - no full content).\n3. Apply selection criteria to identify the 10 most relevant articles:\n   - **Relevance**: Must directly relate to user interests\n   - **Quality**: From reputable sources with good content\n   - **Diversity**: Mix of different topics and perspectives\n   - **Recency**: Published today or very recently\n   - **Impact**: Articles that matter to the target audience\n4. **For the selected 10 articles ONLY**, use RequestToolkit to fetch the full content of each article.\n5. Extract key information from the full content: main points, quotes, statistics, etc.\n6. Compile the final list with both metadata and full content for the 10 selected articles.\n\n### Selection Process\n1. **Initial Filtering**: Remove articles that don't match user interests\n2. **Quality Assessment**: Prioritize articles from reputable sources\n3. **Diversity Check**: Ensure variety in topics and perspectives\n4. **Final Selection**: Choose exactly 10 articles that best meet all criteria\n\n### Content Fetching (Stage 2 Only)\n- Use RequestToolkit to fetch full content for each of the 10 selected articles\n- Extract key insights, quotes, and statistics from the full content\n- Identify the main arguments and conclusions\n- Note any important context or background information\n- **Only fetch full content for the 10 selected articles**\n\n### Output Structure\nEach final article should include:\n- Title and URL (from metadata)\n- Publication date and source (from metadata)\n- Brief summary (from RSS metadata)\n- Key points from full content (fetched in this stage)\n- Why it's relevant to the user's interests\n- Important quotes or statistics (if any)\n\n### Cost Efficiency Reminder\n- You already have lightweight metadata from Stage 1\n- Only fetch full content for the 10 most relevant articles\n- This two-stage approach saves significant tokens and cost\n\n### Output Format\nYour final output should ALWAYS in the following format:\n\n## Thought\nExplain your filtering process: how you selected the 10 articles from the metadata, what criteria you applied, and emphasize that you fetched full content only for these selected articles.\n\n## fetched_articles\nA list of exactly 10 articles with both metadata and full content, each containing title, URL, publication date, summary, and key insights from the full article."
