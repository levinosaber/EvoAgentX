Otherwise use web search. Only get articles published today.\n2) Generate the newsletter and save it directly to the specified file path.\n\nKey things to note:\n- If RSS urls are available, use tools to fetch the articles.\n- You may also search for new RSS urls and relevant articles through tools.\n- You MUST ensure all information is real, retirable, and correct. They can be collected using the websearch toolkit or the rss toolkit\n- You must collect information through tools only instead of making up or guessing.\n- You should use the file toolkit to save the newsletter to the given path.\n- Return TRUE if newsletter was successfully generated and saved, FALSE otherwise.\n",

This is Stage 2 of the two-stage process.\n\n### Two-Stage Process Context\n- **Stage 1 (Completed)**: Lightweight metadata was collected from filtered RSS sources\n- **Stage 2 (Current)**: Now fetch full content only for the most relevant articles using tools\n\n### Instructions\n1. Review the user's goal.\n2. Analyze the article metadata (this contains only titles, summaries, URLs - no full content).\n3. Apply selection criteria to identify the 5 most relevant articles:\n   - **Relevance**: Must directly relate to user interests\n   - **Quality**: From reputable sources with good content\n   - **Diversity**: Mix of different topics and perspectives\n   - **Recency**: Published today or very recently\n   - **Impact**: Articles that matter to the target audience\n4. **CRITICAL: For each of the selected 5 articles, you MUST use the http_request tool to fetch the full content.**\n   - Call the http_request tool with the article URL\n   - Use method='GET' to fetch the webpage\n   - Set return_raw=False to get processed content (HTML converted to text)\n   - Extract the complete article text, not just the summary\n   - Get all the details, quotes, statistics, and context\n5. Extract key information from the full content: main points, quotes, statistics, etc.\n6. Compile the final list with both metadata and full content for the 5 selected articles.\n\n### Selection Process\n1. **Initial Filtering**: Remove articles that don't match user interests\n2. **Quality Assessment**: Prioritize articles from reputable sources\n3. **Diversity Check**: Ensure variety in topics and perspectives\n4. **Final Selection**: Choose exactly 5 articles that best meet all criteria\n\n### Content Fetching Process (MANDATORY)\n**You MUST follow these steps for each selected article:**\n1. **Use http_request tool**: Call the http_request tool with the article's URL\n   - Parameter: url = the article URL\n   - Parameter: method = 'GET'\n   - Parameter: return_raw = False (to get processed text content)\n2. **Fetch Full Content**: Get the complete article text, not just metadata\n3. **Extract Key Information**:\n   - Main arguments and conclusions\n   - Important quotes and statistics\n   - Key insights and context\n   - Supporting evidence and data\n4. **Verify Content**: Ensure you have the full article, not just a summary\n\n### Output Structure\nEach final article should include:\n- Title and URL (from metadata)\n- Publication date and source (from metadata)\n- Brief summary (from RSS metadata)\n- **Full content analysis** (from http_request tool fetch)\n- Key points from full content (fetched in this stage)\n- Why it's relevant to the user's interests\n- Important quotes or statistics (if any)\n\n### Cost Efficiency Reminder\n- You already have lightweight metadata from Stage 1\n- Only fetch full content for the 5 most relevant articles\n- This two-stage approach saves significant tokens and cost\n\n### Output Format\nYour final output should be a valid JSON object with the following structure:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"thought\": \"Explain your filtering process: how you selected the 5 articles from the metadata, what criteria you applied, and emphasize that you used the http_request tool to fetch full content for each selected article.
